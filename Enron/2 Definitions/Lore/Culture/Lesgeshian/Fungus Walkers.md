#### Overview
The **Fungus Walkers** are a magical mutation that has become synonymous with the [[3 Western Swamp|Western Swamp]]. These entities are neither fully alive nor dead, existing as animated fungal colonies that have overtaken organic hosts. Their presence is a defining aspect of the swamp’s mystique and danger.

#### Appearance
- Resemble humanoid or animal forms, twisted and reshaped by fungal growth.
- Mushrooms, moss, and fungal stalks protrude from their bodies, giving them an eerie, grotesque appearance.
- Glow faintly in the dark, making them visible but no less terrifying.

#### Behavior
- Wander aimlessly through the swamp, drawn to disturbances in the fog or spores.
- React aggressively to outsiders but are generally neutral toward the native [[Lesgeshians]].
- Capable of spreading the [[Lesgesh Spores]] further, infecting and converting new hosts over time.

#### Origins
The Fungus Walkers are believed to be the result of prolonged spore exposure to creatures within the swamp. As the spores take hold, the host’s body becomes overtaken by fungal growth, eventually animating as a walker. The [[Lesgeshians]] see them as a natural extension of the swamp’s cycle, neither fearing nor interfering with them unless necessary.
