#### Overview
The **Lesgesh Spores** are a magical, airborne phenomenon that saturates the [[3 Western Swamp|Western Swamp]]. These spores are a fundamental part of the region, binding its ecosystem together and playing a crucial role in maintaining the structures of [[Lesgesh]]. They are both a blessing and a curse, sustaining life in the swamp while posing a lethal threat to outsiders.

#### Properties
- **Binding Magic**: The spores act as a magical adhesive, fusing moss, fungus, and decayed wood into a cohesive material. This property enables the inhabitants of Lesgesh to maintain their precarious settlement.
- **Atmospheric Spread**: Spores drift through the swamp in thick clouds, clinging to all surfaces and slowly seeping into anything exposed to the air.

#### Effects on Non-Lesgeshians
- **Short-Term Exposure**:
  - Disorientation
  - Coughing and irritation of the lungs
  - A subtle sense of unease
- **Prolonged Exposure**:
  - Hallucinations
  - Muscle weakness and fatigue
  - Visible fungal growth on the skin, leading to eventual corruption or death if untreated.

#### Immunity
The native [[Fungus Walkers]] have adapted to the spores over generations. Their immune systems and possibly their connection to the [[Fungus Walkers]] have rendered them unaffected by the spores' harmful effects.
