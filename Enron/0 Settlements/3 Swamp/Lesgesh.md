#Location #Settlement

#### Overview
Lesgesh is a settlement spread across the murky expanse of the [[3 Western Swamp|Western Swamp]]. Unlike centralized villages, Lesgesh consists of scattered lifted huts and buildings connected by sagging rope bridges. The entire settlement appears to float precariously above the sludge, supported by decaying wooden stilts. However, the decay is deceptive—Lesgesh’s structures remain intact thanks to the **magic organic growth** that weaves through the swamp. Spores drifting in the humid air bind moss, fungus, and rot into a cohesive, unnatural durability.

#### Atmosphere and Spores
The swamp air is saturated with **[[Lesgesh Spores]]**, a magical phenomenon unique to this region. These spores cling to every surface and even individuals entering the swamp. While harmless to the native [[Fungus Walkers]], the spores affect non-[[Lesgeshians]] over time:
- **Short-Term Effects**: Mild disorientation, coughing, and a faint feeling of unease.
- **Long-Term Effects**: Prolonged exposure leads to hallucinations, extreme fatigue, and eventual fungal growth on the skin, which can result in permanent corruption or death.

#### Inhabitants
The inhabitants of Lesgesh are reclusive and hostile, mistrusting outsiders who encroach on their territory. They live simple, primal lives, relying on the swamp’s bounty to survive. Their culture is deeply intertwined with the magic of the **[[Fungus Walkers]]** and the [[3 Western Swamp|Swamp]].

#### Unique Features
- **Raised Architecture**: All structures are built on stilts to avoid the swamp’s constant flooding. Rope bridges connect these huts, forming a web-like layout across the settlement.
- **Magical Rot-Binding**: The decaying appearance of Lesgesh’s structures is deceptive. The spores reinforce the wood, holding it together in a perpetual state of magical decay that defies natural entropy.

#### Connections
- **Western Swamp**: The region surrounding Lesgesh, defined by its dense, magical fog and eerie, fungal flora.
- **Lesgesh Spores**: A pervasive atmospheric element that sustains the settlement but poses danger to outsiders.
- **Fungus Walkers**: Mutated, magical entities that roam the swamp, their presence both feared and revered by the Lesgeshians.
