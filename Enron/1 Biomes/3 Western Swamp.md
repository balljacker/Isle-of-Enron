#Biome

#### Overview
The **Western Swamp** is a dark and foreboding region of [[Enron]], characterized by its dense, magical fog, pervasive humidity, and murky waters. This biome is the home of [[Lesgesh]] and is shaped by its unique ecosystem and the omnipresent **[[Lesgesh Spores]]**.

#### Features
- **Fungal Ecosystem**: Massive mushrooms, glowing fungi, and moss-covered trees dominate the landscape, thriving in the swamp’s stagnant, nutrient-rich waters.
- **Constant Fog**: A thick, magical mist blankets the swamp, limiting visibility and adding an eerie atmosphere to the already hostile environment.
- **Hazardous Terrain**: Quicksand-like sludge, hidden pits, and unstable surfaces make traversing the swamp perilous for outsiders.

#### Inhabitants
- **[[Fungus Walkers]]**: Magical mutations that roam the swamp, adding to its danger.
- **Native Lesgeshians**: Reclusive and hostile to outsiders, these people live in harmony with the swamp’s magic.

#### Challenges
- **Spore Saturation**: Prolonged exposure to the [[Lesgesh Spores]] is deadly to those unadapted, making it difficult for outsiders to remain for long.
- **Hostile Wildlife**: Beyond the [[Fungus Walkers]], other swamp-dwelling creatures lurk, adding another layer of peril.
